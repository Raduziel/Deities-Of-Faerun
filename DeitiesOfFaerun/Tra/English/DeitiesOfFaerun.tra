@101 = ~heartwarder of sune~
@102 = ~Heartwarder of Sune~
@103 = ~HEARTWARDER OF SUNE: Sune (SUE-nee) Firehair is said to be the fairest of the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as well as people falling in love or looking for life-mates, often venerate the Lady Firehair.

Sune herself is said to be benevolent and sometimes whimsical, alternating between deep passions and shallow flirtations. She has been romantically linked with many of the Faerûnian powers in the myths of the Realms, although she has never borne any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona, or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time of Troubles.

Sune is said to share the waters of the Evergold, a sacred pool, with the elven goddess Hanali Celanil, and a friendly but intense rivalry exists between the two over the innate superiority of elven versus human beauty. Sune abhors and actively opposes any force or deity that causes the marring of living beauty.

@201 = ~battleguard of tempus~
@202 = ~Battleguard of Tempus~
@203 = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS: Tempus (TEM-pus) is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side on one day, and against them the next; such is the nature of a war. Tempus is prayed to most of all on the nights before battles and regularly venerated by all warriors, regardless of their alignment. As a result, he is a strong, exuberant, robust god — a warrior's god. Tempus sometimes appears at huge battles and important combats — and on rare occasions to individuals who are in a position to cause great strife by their decisions.

Although mighty and profoundly honorable in battle, Tempus answers to his own warrior's code. He is quiet and solitary in relationship to other Faerûnian deities, pursuing no long-lasting alliances or brief flirtations. He is known to love food, drink, and the hunt, though he loves battle best. In recent years, he has sponsored the Red Knight into godhood. His relationship with her is one of a fond and protective father to a brilliant daughter who works hard and successfully at the family business—war.

His diametric opposite in portfolio, Eldath, he considers naive and weak. However, out of respect for her convictions, he punishes those of his faithful who abuse her priests, shrines, or temples. Perhaps he feels that war has little meaning without peace to define and highlight it. Sune, who considers him a foe, he regards as irrelevant and flighty, and therefore unworthy of being his foe.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@301 = ~strifleader of cyric~
@302 = ~Strifleader of Cyric~
@303 = ~STRIFLEADER OF CYRIC: Cyric (SEER-ick) is a god born of the events of the Time of Troubles. He gained the followers and portfolios of many old evil gods and fights to retain them. His power base is immense, and he is one of the three greater powers of evil in Faerûn. The destruction of Zhentil Keep, along with many of the rest of the woes of Faerûn, may be laid at his feet. In an attempt to further enhance his own power, Cyric created the Cyrinishad, a book that is enchanted to bind the reader slavishly to believing that Cyric is the most important being in the universe, exceeding all others. Cyric made the serious error of reading his own book and is now mad, believing that he himself is the center of the universe and everything that occurs is by his direct intervention.

Cyric's madness has taken a number of forms, including visions and a continual chorus of voices that burble and moan in the back of his mind. These voices may be parts of Cyric's own shattered consciousness or they may be the remains of the gods that Cyric slew or usurped the portfolios of.

Cyric is petty, megalomaniac, and totally self-centered. He enjoys tricking and misleading both well-meaning and corrupt individuals and then revealing his deceit when they have made some fatal mistake in judgment or taken a personally devastating action that will ruin their lives. His favorite libation is the tears of disillusioned dreamers and broken-hearted lovers, which he drinks from a silver chalice encrusted with tiny rubies in the shape of sundered hearts.

Cyric hates the other gods, especially Mystra and Kelemvor, but believes they are his puppets, easily fooled and defeated, existing only on his whim. Due to the consequences of his creation of the Cyrinishad, Cyric abandoned the portfolio of death and the dead to Kelemvor and lost the portfolio of tyranny to Iyachtu Xvim, the Godson of Bane.

Cyric uses his new, twisted, ever-changing home in Pandemonium, the Shattered Keep (Cyric refers to it as the "Castle of the Supreme Throne"), as a base for his future plans for the Realms. Such plans have thus far met varying degrees of success, but Cyric believes that the results are as he himself has declared—since he is the most powerful being in the universe.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@401 = ~nightcloak of shar~
@402 = ~Nightcloak of Shar~
@403 = ~NIGHTCLOAK OF SHAR: Loss is the nature of Shar (SHAHR). One of the Dark Gods, she is a deeply twisted and perverse being of ineffable evil and endless petty hatred and jealousy. She rules over pains hidden but not forgotten, bitterness carefully nurtured away from the light and from others, and quiet revenge for any slight, no matter how old. She is said to have the power to make her devout followers forget their pain, yet what occurs is that they become inured to the loss, treating it as a common and natural state of being. The basic inanity of life and foolishness of hope are the cotnerstones of Shar's being. She revels in the concealed, in that which is hidden, never to be revealed. She can always clearly perceive every being, object, and act performed within darkness.

In temples, representations of the goddess are either a black sphere outlined in racing, magically animated flames of purple or paintings of a beautiful human with long, raven-black hair dressed in swirling dark garb. She smiles coldly and her large eyes have black pupils and are otherwise solid purple.

Shar is the mortal enemy of Selûne and battles her ceaselessly on many planes through mortal worshipers and servitor creatures. The undying enmity between the two goddesses is older than recorded time.

During the Time of Troubles, Shar killed Ibrandul, a lesser power of caverns, dungeons, and the Underdark worshiped in Calimshan, the Shining South, and even Waterdeep, for daring to subvert those who venerate the dark away from her. She appropriated his portfolio. She continues to grant the clergy of Ibrandul spells in Ibrandul's name. She is quietly delighted that she is able to use this puppet church to subvert the worship of Selûne without drawing attention to her most faithful worshipers.

The four effects of the spell are as follows:

CHARM: The Nightcloak can charm a single person or monster. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a Domination spell.

FEAR: The Nightcloak can cause fear. The subject flees in blind terror for the duration of the spell.

SICKEN: This power enables the caster to cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. The target will suffer a -4 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Armor Class, Thac0, damage and a 50% penalty to its Movement Rate.

@501 = ~alaghar of clangeddin~
@502 = ~Alaghar of Clangeddin~
@503 = ~ALAGHAR OF CLANGEDDIN: Clangeddin Silverbeard (CLAN-gehd-din SIHL-vur-beerd) is the Father of Battle and primary dwarven war god. All dwarves who must fight, especially dwarves who are warriors by profession, worship Clangeddin, their patron and exultant leader in war. The Father of Battle is the deity of choice among lawful neutral dwarven warriors.

Clangeddin watches over the battle-skills and performances of dwarves from his mountain fortress in Arcadia. He encourages valor in battle, weapon-mastery and training, and wisdom in war, and most often manifests his powers to further these aims. Clangeddin is concerned with war as a way of life and is very different from Moradin in this respect. The aptly named Father of Battle especially hates giants and has taught the dwarves - and the gnomes, through their gods - special ways of fighting giant-type creatures.

Clangeddin is a resolute warrior who never backs down from danger and who refuses to surrender even when all seems lost. He is a strict and ethical deity who brooks no treachery or deceit and who never negotiates or compromises. Triumph must be obtained through valor and bravery, and Clangeddin is swift to humble and humiliate any who overcome by cowardly or deceitful means. The Father of Battle is known for often snatching victory from the narrowest of margins in battle. Clangeddin uses his magic only to influence events indirectly, never in battle. He only resorts to influencing a battle when the very existence of his avatar in the Realms is threatened. He always prefers force of arms to spells. Clangeddin is merry in battle, roaring appreciation of shrewd strategies, bravery, and feats of skill even when such are directed against him. He often sings (both stirring battle-ballads and taunting little ditties to unnerve enemies) in the midst of a fight, and dwarves have learned to listen for hints, cues, and warnings in his lyrics. He is a master at turning the tables on enemy armies by anticipating their movements on the battlefield and singing directions to dwarves fighting with him. Like most dwarves, Clangeddin admires most those who help themselves. He typically appears at a battle only to right hopeless odds against dwarves, to balance treachery and punish the treasonous, and to aid the weak of all races against evil, especially the acts of giants.

@601 = ~hoodwinker of baravar~
@602 = ~Hoodwinker of Baravar~
@603 = ~HOODWINKER OF BARAVAR: Baravar Cloakshadow (BARE-uh-vahr CLOKE-sha-doh) is a sly, sneaky protector of the Forgotten Folk. His defenses and protective strategies are rooted in deceit-illusions, traps, ambushes, and the like-and his jests and tricks may cause their victims some pain (emotional if not physical). In addition to teaching the arts of disguise, stealth, and spying to the gnomes, the Sly One creates traps and illusions of incredible depth and cunning, a skill he has passed on to gnomes throughout the Realms. As the patron of illusions, Baravar is the preeminent gnome god of magic. The Sly One oversees the magical arts of gnome magical craftsfolk as well. All those who survive by their wits venerate Baravar, particularly those who must often combat kobolds, goblins, and other humanoids. Most gnome wizards venerate the Sly One as well, though they do not necessarily participate in their god's ongoing war with the goblinkin powers.

Baravar is closely allied with the other gods of the gnome pantheon, and despite Baravar's somewhat mean-spirited nature, the Sly One follows Garl's lead in emphasizing trickery over strength. Baravar works closely with Segojan Earthcaller, as the Lord of the Burrow once included illusions in his portfolio, and Callarduran Smoothhands, for many deep gnomes are well versed in the art of magical deception. While the Baravar and Gaerdal Ironhand share similar concerns, Baravar's deceits do not sit well with the Shield of the Golden Hills and Gaerdal sometimes chooses to foil the Sly One's plans. Baravar has a genuine dislike for deities of many goblinkin races, particularly the powers of the goblin and kobold pantheons, and unlike the other gnome gods, he is none too restrained about expressing his view. Baravar and Leira were once closely allied, and the apparent death of the Leira at the hands of Cyric has earned him Baravar's eternal vengeance.

Baravar is a crafty, vengeful power who specializes in deceptions. He is unforgiving of any who threaten his charges, and he feels no compunctions about acting against those who have earned his enmity. Although he shares Carl's love of a good practical joke, Baravar's jests and tricks may cause no small discomfort to the victims. He is also a thief and enjoys using illusions to confuse creatures before robbing them. Baravar most often steals out of sheer boredom. The Sly One dispatches avatars to defend gnomes oppressed by humanoids; he often sends one to harass goblinkin from a distance even before they threaten gnomes: "Do unto them before they have a chance to do unto you" is a philosophy he often acts upon.

Armor: All up to and including studded leather armor.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@701 = ~fastpaw of baervan~
@702 = ~Fastpaw of Baervan~
@703 = ~FASTPAW OF BAERVAN: Baervan Wildwanderer (BAY-ur-van WILD-WAN-der-er) is the god of forest-dwelling gnomes and their communities, travel, and the outdoors. Hi loves oak trees and all forest animals and is . guardian of the wild. Baervan gifted forest gnomes with the ability to communicate with forest animals, and taught them to how to hide in and move through wooded environments without being detected. The Masked Leaf is the patron god of forest gnomes, but he is well loved by all of the gnome subraces. He is even revered by the svirfneblin as the Father of Fish and Fungus. Baervan is worshiped by those who love the woodlands, as well as many wanderers, thieves, fighter/thieves, and fighters, particularly those who prefer living in the outdoors rather than in a city all the time.

Baervan's friend and constant companion in his escapades is a giant raccoon named Chiktikka Fastpaws, who is highly intelligent but prone to act before he thinks. Many stories are told of the adventures that this duo has shared, often started by Chiktikka's humorous ability to get into trouble by borrowing something valuable, such as a minor artifact. Baervan is closely allied with the other gods of the gnome pantheon, with the notable exception of Urdlen. He works closely with Segojan Earthcaller, for both gods are concerned with the natural world.

Traditionally, their portfolios are divided between caring for forest animals and plants for Baervan, and burrowing animals for Segojan. Baervan sometimes accompanies Garl, or even Baravar, on their mischievous escapades, and the trio's shared interest in mischief embodies and encourages this aspect of the gnome psyche. Baervan's carefree nature and penchant for jests strains the patience of Gaerdal Iron-hand, albeit not to the extent that the pranks of Baravar Cloakshadow do. Baervan is closely allied with many of the sylvan powers of the Seelie Court. His passion for oak trees has led to his endless, if so far fruitless, pursuit of Verenestra's affections. The Masked Leaf is a frequent participant in the councils of Emmantiensien, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus, though he rarely has the patience to sit through an entire discussion with these slow-speaking woodland giants. Baervan has few foes aside from Urdlen, although the Beastlord has earned his ire for hunting forest gnomes under the Masked Leaf's protection.

Baervan is gentle, good-natured, and mischievous. His penchant for good-natured pranks rivals Garl Glittergold. Except for Chiktikka's company, he tends to keep to himself. Though Baervan sometimes plays jokes on others, it is hard not to like him. The Masked Leaf's tricks are often designed to serve some purpose, unlike the mischief typical of Forgotten Folk. If Baervan wants to send someone a message, he does so in the form of a joke. Baervan dispatches avatars to help repair severe damage to nature, though sometimes just to create mischief.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to change a specially prepared staff into a treant-like creature of the largest size, about 24 feet tall. When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treant-like creature. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for 10 turns or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first.

If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdust-like powder and the staff is destroyed.~

@801 = ~watcher of helm~
@802 = ~Watcher of Helm~
@803 = ~WATCHER OF HELM: Helm (HELM) is the epitome of the guardian, the watcher, the guard, and has in years past been greatly venerated by those who need to remain watchful for evil at their doorsteps. He was once a much more powerful god, but has fallen upon hard times through two actions. During the Time of Troubles, Helm was left with his powers and ordered to hold the gates to the Outer Planes against the other powers of the Realms when the other deities were stripped of their power and confined to the surface of Abeir-Toril. Helm did so all too successfully, and much of the resulting destruction and deific turmoil caused by the many divine deaths of the Godswar is laid at his feet.

Helm is difficult to understand and is often viewed as emotionless, heartless, and devoted only to his duty or goal at the cost of all mortal consideration. While he is devoted to the point of obsession, he is not heartless, but merely a stern disciplinarian. He is fond of children and has been known to be most uncharacteristically lenient (for Helm) when dealing with small infractions by them or on their behalf.

In attempting to comprehend Helm's driven nature, many mortal sages have attempted to account for him throwing himself into his work by blaming his behavior on a broken heart caused by long-unrequited or spurned love. Others say he lost a great love to tragedy or eternally grieves for a lost relative, such as a brother, sister, or child. Still others account for his behavior more coldly as a burning ambition to become the greatest of deities. Helm has never given credence to any of these theories, as he considers such speculations frivolous use of time that could be spent more honestly at productive work.

Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds 
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: One magical mace
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables a Watcher to create a magical mace in <PRO_HISHER> hand. The Mace of Odo is wielded immediately when casting is complete and protects the Watcher against all level 1 and level 2 spells.

A Mace of Odo strikes as a +5 weapon and does 3d6+5 points of damage. Creatures of 2 HD or less must make a successful Saving Throw vs. Paralyzation when struck by the mace or be paralyzed for 3 turns.

The mace vanishes after one strike or after 4 rounds.~

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection 
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is known as wyvern watch because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting, which vaguely resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion. Any creature that approaches the guarded area may be affected by the "wyvern" and must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spells or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the Watcher, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern-form, and the intruder was not affected.~
@808 = ~Seeking Sword~
@809 = ~Seeking Sword
(Evocation)

Sphere: Creation 
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a shimmering blade of force that appears as a sword of any description the caster desires, typically a broad sword. The sword forms in midair and is animated by the will of the caster (who need never touch it), flashing about as it attacks. The blade can strike four times per round, doing 2d4 points of damage with each successful hit, but cannot act beyond the caster's line of sight.

Although it has no attack or damage bonuses, a Seeking Sword is considered a +4 magical weapon for determining what sorts of beings it can strike and can only be harmed by fire, electricity, magic, acid or crushing damage. Other spell casting is impossible for the duration of the spell.~

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@901 = ~stormcaller of talos~
@902 = ~Stormcaller of Talos~
@903 = ~STORMCALLER OF TALOS: Talos (TAH-los) is the destructive force of nature. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and general destruction. He attracts the destroyer, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. His actions often seem petty and vengeful and are frequently motivated by rage, anger, and the desire to not appear weak or compromising in any way to his followers or the other powers of Faerûn. He exults in seeing what he or his followers can burn, break, flood, kill or otherwise utterly destroy. He is like a malicious and twisted child whose power and wrath know no bounds and who proves his self-worth and standing again and again by raining havoc and ruin down on those who can little oppose him. Under the alias of Malyk, Talos is trying to fold wild and destructive magic into his portfolio. Mystra is openly challenging the Storm Lord's ploy, and it is likely to fail quickly in the face of her open opposition.

When Talos is portrayed in religious art, he looks similar to his avatar. His home, the Towers of Ruin, is also known as the Screaming Towers and the Towers at the Heart of the Winds because of the howling winds that curl eternally around it in a helix. He is served by Auril, Malar, and Umberlee. Collectively, the four are known as the Gods of Fury. The storm god's relationship with Auril is said to be close and cordial, though he has no compunction about attempting to erode and usurp her portfolio and power base whenever possible. His relationship with Umberlee is flirtatious and filled with rivalry. Talos and Malar only grudgingly work together, and Malar would happily kill Talos if he only had the power to do so. Talos has recently sponsored the once-mortal Velsharoon the Vaunted to demipower status, but Velsharoon is not likely to survive long with the sort of "aid" Talos seems to be providing powers in his service.

Aside from his divine foes listed above, Talos counts among his enemies all those who dare to work magic to try to control the winds and weather in an ongoing or wide-ranging fashion, including the mortal wizards of Netheril and Myth Drannor in the past and the wizards of Halruaa and Thay currently.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@1001 = ~dawnbringer of lathander~
@1002 = ~Dawnbringer of Lathander~
@1003 = ~DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: A powerful, exuberant god, Lathander (Lah-THANder) is known as the Commander of Creativity and the Morninglord. When Lathander is depicted, he is most often shown in a form similar to his avatar or as a mist of glowing, rose-colored swirls with two golden eyes at the center. As the god of beginnings, Lathander traditionally receives prayer from many inhabitants of Faerûn at the start of a journey or endeavor. Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and start new ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very popular among the merchant classes. Though depicted as young, Lathander's noble bearing and demeanor serve him well among the nobility, who also favor his worship in many places. Because he encourages his clergy to strike out and start new shrines and temples all over Faerûn, Lathander's broad-based popularity is rounded out by the many peasant folk aided by his clergy. 

Lathander has a reputation for being sometimes overly enthusiastic, slightly vain, and given to excesses, all flaws very common among the young. He is also eternally optimistic and doggedly perseverant. His alliance with Chauntea serves them both well, since his interests in birth, nurture, and vibrant life dovetail well with her portfolio. The churches of Chauntea and Lathandet have only grown closer since the Time of Troubles, and rumors hold that Lathander has been courting the favor of the Earthmother romantically as well as politically.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@1101 = ~holy justice of tyr~
@1102 = ~Holy Justice of Tyr~
@1103 = ~HOLY JUSTICE OF TYR: When he is depicted in religious art, Tyr (TEER) appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in proving his resilience and strength of spirit. In recent years, he has been shown blinded as well, a fatality of the wrath of Ao during the Time of Troubles. Tyr's symbol shows his nature: justice through benevolent force and armed vigilance. He opposes all beings who deal in trickery, rule-breaking, and unjust destruction or misdeeds. He is said to be a latecomer among the powers of Faerun, appearing over a millennium ago but after most other Realms powers had established themselves. His faith is popular, as everyone knows exactly what Tyr expects his faithful to do and everyone can trust Tyrrans to be honorable, honest, just, and righteous.

Tyr is rather enigmatic to those outside his faith. He represents such stern justice that it is difficult to see the more subtle qualities of the god. He is a courageous father figure to his faithful and struggles continually to achieve for his followers a paradisiacal state of affairs in Faerûn that he knows will never come in an imperfect world. In his more affectionate moods, he sometimes refers to his abode in Lunia as the Just House, and one senses from him at times an odd sort of longing to want to be able to deal with troubles as one could among a perfect family: with love, courage, and the knowledge that everyone will try their best and not betray their fellows because of a special bond that all share. Unfortunately, he also knows that this will never happen, and so emits an undercurrent of stern sadness for what can never be. He is terribly protective of his priesthood, and because of this, he is more likely to manifest in some form to aid them than many other powers.

Torm and Ilmater serve Tyr, and the three deities are sometimes called the Triad.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@1201 = ~lorekeeper of oghma~
@1202 = ~Lorekeeper of Oghma~
@1203 = ~LOREKEEPER OF OGHMA: Oghma (OGG-mah) is the most powerful god of knowledge in Faerûn. Much as Mystra of old was said to sit in judgment of each new spell, Oghma is said to decide whether a new idea would be known to the world or confined to its originator. Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma favors. He is on good relations with the artificer god, Gond Wonderbringer, who serves him by giving ideas manifest form, but their relationship has sometimes become tense due to Gond's proclivity to press for the rapid introduction of new devices throughout Faerûn. In Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden, Oghma is worshiped as part of the Adama, the Durparian concept of a world spirit that embraces and enfolds the divine essence that is part of all beings. Here he is known as Curna, goddess of wisdom.

Oghma is a cheerful and wise power whose ability to persuade others to his point of view he puts to endless use. He can be solemn and righteous, but he is more often quietly humorous and quick to smile. His one flaw may be his fondness for his own thoughts; he tends to implement rather convoluted plots that he has worked out first in his own mind rather than to take direct action.

@1301 = ~painbearer of ilmater~
@1302 = ~Painbearer of Ilmater~
@1303 = ~PAINBEARER OF ILMATER: Ilmater (Ihl-MAY-ter) offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated.

Ilmater is quiet, kind, good-spirited, and slow to anger. He appreciates a humorous story and has a rather rustic humor himself. When his avatar appears, he takes assaults upon his person passively and rarely lifts a hand against another. He is not totally nonviolent, though, as many often assume by his doctrine of endurance. When facing cruelties and atrocities his rage can boil up, and then he is a figure of frighteningly righteous wrath. His appearance can frighten the young, but he takes great care to reassure them as he treasures children and all young creatures, taking exceptional offense at those who would abuse or harm them.

Ilmater is allied to and serves Tyr, aiding the blinded god in his travels and teaching him to live without his sight but to rely more upon his feelings. He is also on very good terms with Torm, who also serves Tyr, and the three deities are known collectively as the Triad.

Ilmater's symbol in the early days was the blood-stained rack, but since the Godswar the use of a pair white hands bound with blood-red cord has come into almost exclusive use. This newer symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large.

@1401 = ~dweomerkeeper of mystra~
@1402 = ~Dweomerkeeper of Mystra~
@1403 = ~DWEOMERKEEPER OF MYSTRA: Mystra (MISS-trah) is the goddess of magic and with that the goddess of possibilities, which makes her arguably the most powerful deity in Faerûn and possibly throughout Realmspace. She is said to have taught the first spellcaster of the Realms, and to have enabled many of the races to use magic. She supposedly weighs and judges each new spell or magical item to determine whether it should be permitted into the Realms. She is most venerated by wizards and those who use magic or magical items in their daily use. She differs from Azuth in that Azuth is the god of wizards (as to a much lesser degree, all spellcasters), while Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit to enable mortal spellcasters and magical crafters to safely access the raw force that is magic. Mystran advisers are common in Azuthian churches, and vice versa.

During the Time of Troubles, the former incarnation of the goddess of magic, Mystra, was destroyed and her essence merged with that of the land itself. A new goddess of magic, arising from the human form of the magician Midnight, took the mantle of divinity and the goddess's portfolio. At this time, the goddess of magic's alignment shifted from lawful neutral, maintaining the balance in use of magic, to neutral good, reflecting the new incarnation's attitudes toward the uses and purpose of magic. Rather than forcing her worshipers to change their ways, Midnight has taken a conservative, long-term strategy by assuming the name and trappings of her predecessor to make the change as smooth as possible for her church and worshipers. Midnight is now revered within the church as the human avatar of Mystra, and her form now graces the avatar of the goddess when she walks the Realms seeking to rebalance the dead and wild magic areas of the land. 

In the past, Mystra contested with Talos and Gond as rivals and with both Bane, and later, Cyric over attempts to control or usurp her power. She despises Cyric.

Mystra is fond of Kelemvor, Lord of the Dead, who was her love during her mortal life. Whether their relationship will again blossom into love is yet to be seen. She is aided in her work by Azuth, Dornal the Watcher, and by her Chosen: Elminster, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, and the Seven Sisters. Mystra is also served by the Magister, a title borne by a single mortal worker of the magical arts chosen by victory in one-on-one spell combat to be champion of magic. The Magister is also one of the Chosen of Mystra. The current Magister, Lady Magister Noumea, was elevated to the position in 1354 DR.

@1501 = ~holy champion of torm~
@1502 = ~Holy Champion of Torm~
@1503 = ~HOLY CHAMPION OF TORM: Torm (TORM) is the patron of paladins and those who face danger for a greater good. In life, Torm was the most faithful of warriors, obeying all the commands of his king regardless of personal danger. Today he is the war arm and champion of Tyr, Lord of Justice, delivering justice to those who are evil, deceitful, and destructive, and acting to keep law, order, and loyalty everywhere. The Loyal Fury is unflinching in his duty and judges his faithful accordingly. He is stern, righteous, and unyielding, yet his heart is filled first and foremost with goodness, and he can be a kind and gentle power when dealing with the young, the weak, and faithful friends of all sorts.

Together, Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr are sometimes called the Triad. Torm and Ilmater see themselves serving as opposite sides of the same coin and are close allies and friends. Torm and Helm have always been allies, although their followers are often rivals. At Tyr's urging, Torm has begun to cultivate a close relationship with the Red Knight in the hope of drawing her into the fold of justice and away from war for its own sake.

Torm figured significantly in the struggle over the Tablets of Fate during the Time of Troubles. Prior to his battle with Bane, Lord of Strife, Torm discovered a great evil being done in his name by his then-current high priest (named Tenwealth). The followers of Torm had always dominated the religious and political activity of Tantras, but during the time of Torm's Coming, they began to actively persecute all "unbelievers" (in other words, followers of other gods). With the aid of the fallen cleric of Sune named Adon, Torm implicated the chief conspirators and accused them of their crimes.

When the avatar of Bane marched across the Dragonreach to seize the Tablet of Fate hidden in Torm's temple (without the Lord of Duty's knowledge), Torm absorbed the souls of many of his true worshipers, including the heretical leaders of his clergy, and assumed the form of a monstrous lion-headed man. He then battled Bane in a battle of mutual destruction, in the process destroying the besieging Zhentarim navy and creating many dead magic areas.

Because Torm died in service to his own ethos (following orders) and Torm's native plane was the Prime Material itself, he was reinstated by Lord Ao. Soon after, Tyr rewarded his faithful paladin with elevation to lesser power status. In the Year of the Sword, the Lonely Citadel, an isolated single-turreted tower of massive size that crowned a rocky spire in the remote Ice Mountains north of Citadel Adbar, vanished in a burst of divine radiance and reappeared on the flanks of Mt. Celestia as Torm ascended to the Outer Planes. It now forms the heart of his realm, Trueheart, on the layer of Mercuria.

Torm was also active in the battle against Cyric 10 years after the Time of Troubles. The Lord of Duty assisted Mystra, Oghma, and Mask in dethroning Cyric as Lord of the Dead, although Cyric was not destroyed. Torm's actions have earned him and his followers the undying hatred of Cyric, Prince of Lies.

Torm still frequently stalks the Realms in avatar form, as he did when he was a demipower, battling legendary monsters and evil incarnate. In the liturgy of the Tormish church, it is said that Torm will perish in the final battle of the gods, saving the Realms once and for all from Cyric's madness by his self-sacrifice.

@1601 = ~silentwalker of mask~
@1602 = ~Silentwalker of Mask~
@1603 = ~SILENT WALKER OF MASK: Mask (MASK) was the deity of intrigue along with being the patron of thieves, but his disastrous perusal of the Cyrinishad led to Cyric being able to steal this aspect of his portfolio from him. One school of thought believed the god totally destroyed after reading the Cyrinishad and having his Godsbane avatar form destroyed by Cyric, another held that Mask was totally subsumed by Cyric, and a third school believed that Mask, engaged in his own intrigues, faked his loyalty to Cyric and later his own death. The truth is that Mask survived the enslaving effects of the Cyrinishad and the destruction of a major avatar form at great cost, losing much of his godly power in the process.

Mask had allowed his intrigue with Cyric to progress so far that he had neglected his own worshipers and was effectively but a lesser power when hit by the effects of the Cyrinishad. When forced to cut away part of his divine power, leaving it in Cyric's hands, Mask was temporarily reduced to the status of a demipower. To make matters worse, Mask crossed a powerful extraplanar entity known as Kezef the Chaos Hound, who has sworn eternal revenge. Mask cannot remain too long in one location or Kezef catches up to him, and Mask does not wish to confront the Chaos Hound until he regains the status of an intermediate power that he had just after the Godswar. Such is the price of intrigue, a price that Mask has paid dearly. (The Chaos Hound's chase has slowed somewhat of late, though, as it becomes distracted by the new-found joys of freedom after so many years of imprisonment.)

Mask's form is ever-changing in regard to appearance—and his true form is not known for sure. Mask remains the patron of thieves, and there his faith is strongest. After a year of frenzied activity by his priests on his behalf (at his encouragement), Mask has taken shadows into his portfolio and managed to climb to the status of lesser power. However, Mask is still a weakened power and walks (or runs, when the Chaos Hound is abroad) carefully in his dealings with the other powers. For the time being, he wants to remain out of the sight (and hopefully out of the mind) of Cyric, who might still covet his remaining power, but he is already plotting ways and means to regain that which he lost to the Mad God.

Mask is very self-possessed and confident—too confident for his own good. He enjoys erecting convoluted and intricate plots to achieve his ends and then playing them out to his benefit. As he has recently learned, however, such predilections proved a weakness for him, and he is now trying much more direct methods to accomplish his goals than before in order to avoid such needless—and unwanted—plot twists as nearly cost him his life and his godhood in his manipulations of Cyric.

SHADOWCLOAK

The Silentwalker surrounds itself with dense shadows, completely silencing <PRO_HISHER> sounds and being protected against physical attacks.~
@1604 = ~Shadowcloak~
@1605 = ~Shadowcloak
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Darkness, Trickery
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a semisolid fog of amorphous shape that engulfs the caster and moves with <PRO_HIMHER> for the duration of the spell.

A shadowcloak both confuses attackers with its swirling, smoky chaos, and slows strikes, so that all attacks against the shadowcloak-user occur at a -3 attack penalty and a damage penalty of-1 point per die. The shadowcloak also muffles all sounds made by the cloaked being (regardless of that being's desires), so that even shouted speech seems faint and distant, and all sounds short of breakage or metallic ringing or clinking are very likely to be completely blanked out.

The shadowcloak grants to the Silentwalker a 100% bonus to Move Silently and a 50% bonus do Hide in Shadows.~

@1701 = ~icevassal of auril~
@1702 = ~Icevassal of Auril~
@1703 = ~ICEVASSAL OF AURIL: Auril (AWE-ril) is most powerful in those regions that are affected by deep winters or crouch at the edges of the Great Glacier. She is worshiped primarily out of fear. She serves Talos and is one of the Gods of Fury, and much of her ethos is similar to that of the god of nature's destruction. She has seen much of her personal power eroded by Talos, and as a result, the winters have grown colder in the past decade to remind the northerners who still controls the power of cold. While she can call on the other Gods of Fury for aid, she only does so with Umberlee with any confidence; Talos usually responds but then directs all the glory and worship to himself, and Malar despises her. The feeling is mutual.

She is a fickle, vain, and evil creature whose cold divine heart remains untouched by any hint of true love, noble feeling, or honor. She often toys with those who offend her, trapping them in snow storms and then driving them insane by tantalizing them with visions of warmth and the comforts of home before she freezes them to death. Her eternal beauty is cold and deadly, the flower of womanhood preserved forever in a slab of arctic ice—with sensibilities to match the ice.

Weightless and nonmetallic, it is considered a +2 enchanted weapon for purposes of determining what it can hit and strikes at THACO 6, regardless of the caster's normal combat abilities.

Upon casting a Conjure Ice Elemental spell, the Icevassal opens a special gate to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, and an ice elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.~

@1801 = ~talon of malar~
@1802 = ~Talon of Malar~
@1803 = ~TALON OF MALAR: Malar (MAH-larr) is the god of the savage wild. Along with Umberlee and Auril, he is one of the Gods of Fury who serve Talos. He is worshiped by hunters who revel in the kill or who hunt for sport or to excess, fallen rangers, sentient carnivores, and lycanthropes. Those who suffer the depredations of wild beasts attempt to placate the Beastlord with offerings of freshly killed and bloody meat, but Malar rarely recognizes their entreaties. In his more favorable aspects he is revered by beings who identify with the untamed nature, grace, and amorality of predators.

Malar achieves almost sensual fulfillment from the hunt and the kill. He revels in the fear radiated by the hunted and hungers for the blood of his prey. He speaks only in low growling undertone or vicious snarl. The Lord of Beasts despises the Balance sought by druids and their deities and seeks to overthrow it through the actions of his faithful. He manifests an avatar in Faerûn in an endless hunt across the Realms whenever the mood strikes him - which is almost constantly.

During the Time of Troubles, Malar stalked the length and breadth of Faerûn. He is known to have battled Nobanion in the Gukhmere Forest in a fierce conflict known as the Roar of Shadows. The Beastlord was driven north and west by the Lion God working in an alliance with the Emerald Enclave. When Malar appeared in the North, he was relentlessly pursued by Gwaeron Windstrom and could not shake the Master of Tracking from his trail. The Beastlord did challenge and defeat Herne, a corrupted incarnation of the Master of the Hunt brought to the Realms by an ancient wave of immigrants along with Oghma and other powers. Herne was venerated by the ores of the High Forest, and Malar has since assumed his portfolio.

In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Malar has been weakened by the growing strength of Talos. As a result, he has been forced to seek new worshipers among the nonhuman tribes, and now numerous humanoids have begun to venerate the Beastlord as an adjunct to their traditional pantheons. Malar has also acquired additional human worshipers from the ranks of a few beast cults by slaying their totem spirits and assuming the animal spirits' portfolios as aspects of his own. One of the first beast totems to fall to his bloody talons was Blue Bear, an Uthgardt beast cult corrupted by pervasive contact with lower planar beings and venerated in other lands as Render, the Bear God.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@1901 = ~waveservant of umberlee~
@1902 = ~Waveservant of Umberlee~
@1903 = ~WAVESERVANT OF UMBERLEE: Umberlee (Um-ber-LEE) the Bitch Queen rules from her watery lair in a flooded level of the Abyss. She is worshiped by most out of fear as opposed to adoration, though some few—such as most weresharks, who she created to try to undermine Selûne - find her ethos to their liking. Ship crews toss her gems over the sides of their vessels to calm storm-tossed waters. She has a large number of shrines in coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers, candles, small candies, or coins on her altars in hopes that Umberlee will spare them on the next voyage. Others who pay tribute to her include merchants sending goods by sea, port cities, and island nations and settlements who would be devastated by her wrath and have not a powerful patron deity to counter her menacing demands.

Umberlee continually contests with Selûne, in whom navigators trust to guide their ships safely home. Of late, she has also felt the heavy presence of her own patron, Talos, who is trying to pick up violent nature in all its forms as his personal portfolio. Though Umberlee flirts with him on occasion, she would gladly end his existence and become sole deity of destruction herself if she had the power. Unfortunately, her ambitions are limited by her inability to directly affect the land, so she bides her time and plays the coquette. Together Auril, Malar, Umberlee, and Talos are known as the Gods of Fury.

Umberlee is just plain malicious, mean, and evil. She breaks agreements on a whim when she feels that she has not gotten the best part of a deal and takes great pleasure in both watching her sharks tear shipwreck victims to shreds and watching others die slowly of drowning. She is also vain and expects to be flattered. If she has any weakness, it is probably her incessant greed for power and her intoxication with exercising it.

Umberlee spent the Time of Troubles in the Sea of Fallen Stars, wreaking destruction on one pirate isle after another. The sea has remained stormy and troubled since that time, though it has calmed somewhat in the last two to three years after an organized effort to appease her promoted by certain allied merchant coasters said to be part of or in league with the Iron Throne.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@2001 = ~silverstar of selûne~
@2002 = ~Silverstar of Selûne~
@2003 = ~SILVERSTAR OF SELÛNE: When Selûne (Seh-LOON-eh) journeys to the Realms, she is said to appear in many forms and is depicted in religious art as everything from a female face on a lunar disk to a dusky-skinned woman with wide, radiant eyes and long ivory-colored hair to a matronly, middle-aged woman whose dark hair is streaked with gray. In Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden, Selûne is worshiped as part of the Adama, the Durparian concept of a world spirit that embraces and enfolds the divine essence that is part of all beings. Here she is known as Lucha, She Who Guides. Lucha oversees connections and relationships, guiding herdsmen to good pastures, blessing marriages, helping lost ships at sea, and ensuring safe births. It can be safely said that as the moon changes, so does the nature of the moon goddess.

Selûne's eternal foe is the evil goddess Shar, and she battles her ceaselessly on many planes of existence, both through mortal worshipers and servitor creatures. The undying enmity between the two goddesses predates the existence of most, if not all, of the present-day existing Faerûnian deities. The enmity between Shar and Selûne carries into their priesthoods, such that open battle often occurs when followers of each faith meet. Selûne also struggles with Umberlee constantly over the fate of ships at sea and with Mask over the works of mischief and evil he performs in the shadows the moon's soft glow creates.

Selûne is a caring but quietly mystical power who often seems saddened by events perhaps millennia old. While she is normally calm and placid, her war with Shar is fierce, with neither side giving or receiving quarter. She is seen in many ways by her followers, who are a diverse group, and she is at times effervescently joyful and active, at others maternal, quiet, and almost poetic, and at yet others warlike and fierce, showing little mercy to her foes.

Before the Time of Troubles, Selûne had served Sune for some centuries after being independent for millennia. After the Godswar, she went her own way again. Her relationship with Sune and Lliira is still extremely friendly and cooperative.

Selûne is served by the Shards, a group of shining female servitors. The Shards can grow wings or banish them as they desire and have long, flowing blue hair and pearly-white skin. They are in reality planetars.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@2101 = ~malagent of talona~
@2102 = ~Malagent of Talona~
@2103 = ~MALAGENT OF TALONA: Talona (Tah-LOW-nah), one of the Dark Gods, is often depicted as a withered old crone with a scarred, tattooed face in religious texts. Where she walks, misfortune and death follow. She is an odd deity. Sages have described her as having the personality of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age: She is alternately desirous of attention at any cost like a small child and aloof like a wounded paramour who has been discarded by her love.

Talona's power slowly wanes after each great plague in Faerûn. When she feels vulnerable in her position, she unleashes another wave of misery and disease-brought death and receives a torrent of prayers entreating her to spare the inhabitants of Faerûn from her withering touch. Her power then waxes again in an endless cycle of indifference, devastation, and appeasement. In particular, Talona's power was ascendant during the destruction of Asram (after the erection of the Standing Stone), in the Year of the Clinging Death (75 DR), during the Rotting War (902 DR), in the Year of the Scourge (1150 DR), in the Year of the Empty Goblet and the Year of Beckoning Death (1252-1253 DR), and during the Great Plague of the Inner Sea (1317-1323 DR).

Some old texts of Talona refer to her as Kiputytto, but this is actually the name of a rival demipower who challenged Talona's portfolio and lost. The battle between the two goddesses destroyed the Netherese survivor state of Asram in its wake. When Kiputytto attacked Talona, Talona plagued the ill-fated Asram in order to obtain the devotional power generated from the worship of its citizens, who hoped to appease Talona and lessen the effects of the disease. Kiputytto responded in kind in the same location, provoking a devastating series of increasingly virulent plagues (perhaps even magical in nature) that overloaded the curative resources of Asram's various priesthoods and wiped out the entire population in less than a month. Even most of those who escaped the scourged area died soon after of disease. Shortly afterward, Talona won this devastating deific contest and murdered Kiputytto.

Representations of Talona's symbol dated to before her battle with Kiputytto show it depicted as a flesh-colored equilateral triangle with point upward containing three teardrops arranged in a triangle with the uppermost black, the lower left purple, and the lower right green. Why the coloration was changed after her triumph over Kiputytto is one of the inner mysteries of the church not ever revealed to outsiders.

While he lived, Talona served Bhaal along with Loviatar, though Loviatar and Talona and are fierce rivals. Loviatar loves to torment and tease Talona over her ugly appearance, her scanty number of followers, her cowardly and ineffectual attacks, and her puny portfolio (in Loviatar's words). Needless to say, Talona openly delights in any setbacks Loviatar experiences, and sometimes even aids good adventurers if she thinks they will damage Loviatar's reputation. Talona has recently cultivated an alliance with Shar

Level: 4
Sphere: Suffering

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a deadly poison in the caster's hand or another chosen limb. Touching a creature will deliver this poison immediately and enforce a Saving Throw vs. Poison.

If the saving throw succeeds, the victim takes 1 point of damage and the corrosive magic eats a hole in any armor or garment worn and causes a disfiguring eruption of the skin beneath the touched area, reducing the target's Charisma by 2. If the saving throw fails, the victim suffers 6 points of damage and is slowed instantly for three rounds and in the next round the second stage of the poison applies.

On this second round, the victim must make another Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the victim suffers 1 point of damage, is corroded as discussed above, and the spell ends. If this second Saving Throw fails, the victim suffers 3d6 points of additional damage, loses another 2 points of Charisma, and the third (and final) stage of the poison begins.

On this third round, the victim must make another Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the victim suffers 1d10 points of poison damage. If it fails, the victim will fall into a coma that will last for 1 turn.~

@2201 = ~pain of loviatar~
@2202 = ~Pain of Loviatar~
@2203 = ~PAIN OF LOVIATAR: Loviatar (Loh-VEE-a-tar), one of the Dark Gods, appears in her religion's art as a pale maiden dressed in white, pleated armor and carrying a bone-white wand, a whip, or a scourge that she uses as a weapon against her foes. She is venerated by torturers, sadists, and other twisted and evil people and creatures, including some non-humans who love to bully other non-humans. While he lived, Loviatar served Bhaal along with Talona, though the two goddesses are heated rivals. Loviatar loves to torment and tease Talona and has more than once expressed the opinion that by all rights Talona ought to and eventually will serve her.

Loviatar is aggressive, domineering, and fearless. She has a cold and calculatingly cruel nature and is also almost unreachable emotionally—toward love, fear, or even hatred. It would have to be a miracle for any deity or mortal to make a dent in her icebound heart. She has an instinct for inflicting both physical and psychological pain, and she always seems to know what to say and the way to say it to inflict the most hurt and raise the biggest self-doubts in someone, mortal or deity. And unlike most simple bullies, she does not fear pain or hurt herself and laughs at attempts to physically damage or verbally humiliate her. The only possible weakness one might use against her is her very calculating nature, which relies on her assumption of the innate selfishness of human nature—beings acting in a self-sacrificing or heroic manner can sometimes snarl her carefully knit plans.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@2301 = ~dreadruler of bane~
@2302 = ~Dreadruler of Bane~
@2303 = ~DREADRULER OF BANE: Bane (BAIN), one of the Dark Gods, was the ultimate tyrant and a thoroughly evil and malicious being who reveled in hatred and strife and was worshiped by those who in turn enjoyed such wickedness. From his throne in the Black Bastion, he ruled over select parts of Faerun through his clergy. In religious art, he was depicted as a looming, brooding black hand ready to crush the world in its palm, as an empty black throne, or as a shadowy, vaguely human-shaped figure garbed in garments of black streaked with red sitting on a throne of skulls. The one constant in these depictions was a jewel-encrusted gauntlet streaked with blood.

While Bane hated most of the Faerunian pantheon, in particular he hated Mystra and dreamed of torturing her and consuming her power. He devoted much research to trying to learn ways in which other gods have in the past subsumed the powers of rival gods whom they destroyed, for Bane desired above all to gain true supreme power by acquiring governance over all magic. This may have been the underlying reason that Bane plotted with Myrkul to steal the Tablets of Fate from Ao, precipitating the Fall of the Gods. The Black Lord was destroyed in conflict with Torm during the Time of Troubles, and his portfolio was given to the once-mortal Cyric by Ao, along with the portfolios of Myrkul and Bhaal. In life, he commanded Bhaal and Iyachtu Xvim, his son, though Xvim performed his designated tasks only reluctantly, as he held no love for his father. Loviatar and Talona served Bane indirectly by serving Bhaal.

Iyachtu Xvim, the Godson, is said to be the result of a union between the Black Lord and a greater or a true tanar'ri, and thus the blood of Bane runs through his veins. (Another tale says he is the spawn of the Lord of Darkness and a corrupted paladin.) Prior to the Time of Troubles, Xvim stalked the Realms for many years, enacting his father's will. With his father's death and Cyric's partial defeat, the Cruel Master has moved to seize his hated father's black throne. If any remaining cultists of Bane ever seek the return of the Dark One, such efforts will certainly be opposed by Xvim, the New Darkness.

Although much of Bane's power was absorbed by Cyric, the Prince of Lies, when the Black Lord was destroyed by Torm, the Lord of Duty, some of it passed on to Iyachtu Xvim, imprisoned deep beneath Zhentil Keep. As is the case with Myrkul, a small fraction of Bane's essence remains in the Realms, but unlike the deceased deity of the dead, Bane's personality was not captured in an artifact. Instead, fragments of his personality were scattered among his 25 or more surviving Baneliches (clerical liches of Bane). In centuries past, the Black Lord had transformed over 35 living High Imperceptors at the end of their tenure into undead "Mouths of Bane"— Baneliches. In the wake of the Godswar, each Banelich now believes itself to be the reincarnated form of Bane, with the expected corresponding megalomaniacal plans for conquering Faerûn. They are also the only known beings in the Realms to either still receive spells from Bane and/or grant themselves clerical spell-like abilities without a living divine patron.

@2401 = ~deathstalker of bhaal~
@2402 = ~Deathstalker of Bhaal~
@2403 = ~DEATHSTALKER OF BHAAL: Bhaal (Bahl), one of the Dark Gods, was the god of death, particularly of slaying, assassination, and violent death. His was a powerful faith in Faerun at one time, and the Lord of Murder was venerated by numerous assassins, violent mercenaries, and other brutal and fiendish killers. While he lived, Loviatar and Talona served him (though the two were rivals to each other), and he in turn served Bane.

Bhaal was violent, cruel, and hateful at all times, and lived only to hunt and murder. He could be alternately cold, calculating, and ruthless or filled with a savage bloodlust. The presence of living creatures instilled a deadly hunger in the Lord of Murder and an overpowering need to kill and destroy. His minions, such as Kazgoroth the Beast in the Moonshae Islands, wrought devastation and violent death wherever they roamed. Bhaal suffered a series of reverses prior to the Time of Troubles, the most vital being his banishment from the Moonshaes. Bhaal tried to destroy the Earthmother (Chauntea) and seize the Moonshae Islands as his personal domain. The Ravager, imbued with a greater fraction of Bhaal's essence than is normally contained in an avatar, was slain by Tristan, High King of the Ffolk, who wielded the Sword of Cymrjch Hugh. As a result, Bhaal was severely weakened and exiled from the Realms for a time.

Before Bhaal could rebuild much of his power, he was returned to Faerûn in avatar form by the will of Ao during the Fall of the Gods. Bhaal, reduced to a killing force able only to possess humans, then went on a spree of murder and destruction the like of which had never before been seen. When LordBane sought the power needed to challenge Torm, he slew all of the assassins in the Realms who made up the bulk of the Lord of Murder's faithful, further reducing Bhaal's power. After the Lord of Strife's destruction, Bhaal forged an alliance with Myrkul. The two gods sought the Tablets of Fate so that they could return to the Outer Planes. After pursuing her across the Heartlands, Bhaal kidnapped Midnight and seized one Tablet of Fate, but was murdered soon after by Cyric with the sword Godsbane (later revealed to have been the avatar form of Mask). What remained of Bhaal's essence was absorbed by the Winding Water, and that river has subsequently been poisonous from the Boareskyr Bridge downstream to the Trollclaw Ford.

It is believed a fragment of Bhaal's personality remains in the jet black, foul-smelling waters of the Winding Water much like Myrkul's essence survives in the Crown of Horns and fragments of Bane's personality survive in his servitor Baneliches. If Bhaal is ever resurrected, it will be in the shadow of Boareskyr Bridge.

@2501 = ~gray one of myrkul~
@2502 = ~Gray One of Myrkul~
@2503 = ~GRAY ONE OF MYRKUL: Myrkul (MER-kul), one of the Dark Gods, was the god of the dead, as opposed to the god of death, which was the province of Bhaal. His portfolio, and his home in Hades, the Bone Castle, were both usurped by Cyric after the Lord of Bones was destroyed atop Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep during the Time of Troubles by Midnight. Later Myrkul's portfolio passed to Kelemvor when Cyric was driven from the City of Strife by an alliance of gods and denizens.

Myrkul had a cold, malignant intelligence, and spoke in a high whisper. He was always alert, never slept, and was never surprised. He was never known to lose his temper or be anything other than coldly amused when a mortal succeeded in avoiding his directives or chosen fates. His influence in Faerûn was imposed through fear, and he was a master of making mortals terrified of him through his words and deeds. At times, just to remain unpredictable, he seemed almost kind and caring. His cowled skull head was known in nightmares all over Faerûn, and he was the one deity that almost all human mortals could picture clearly. Myrkul took care that all mortals thought of him often—he was even known to materialize beside open graves, scythe in hand, just to gaze around at gathering mourners for a few silent seconds before fading away, in order to remind everyone that he was waiting for them all.

@2601 = ~doomguide of kelemvor~
@2602 = ~Doomguide of Kelemvor~
@2603 = ~DOOMGUIDE OF KELEMVOR: Kelemvor (KELL-ehm-vor), a former associate of Midnight, Cyric, and Adon during the events of the Godswar, inherited the portfolio of the god of the dead when Cyric lost those responsibilities following the Cyrinishad debacle. The first official act of the newly created god of the dead was to turn Cyric's Bone Castle into a gleaming tower of crystal, a symbol that this particular god of the dead would hide nothing from his subjects. He intends to impart justice among the dead in an even-handed and fair manner.

Kelemvor is kind, just, forthright, and earnest, though stern at times. He is not terribly clever for a power and tends to try to solve what he perceives as his immediate problems with direct action. Though he means well, he does not always see the difficulties down the road caused by short-term solutions.

Kelemvor has an unexpected ally, at least in terms of traditional godly alliances. He and Mystra, formerly the human Midnight, remain close. They were in love during their mortal lives, but whether this romance has kindled during their godly tenure is a matter they have thus far kept private.

Cyric, who lost his death portfolio to Kelemvor, is Kelemvor's bitter enemy. Cyric views Kelemvor as someone who pointedly and maliciously set out to steal a part of Cyric's rightful power. One traditional foe of the Faerunian god of the dead, Lathander, has not declared against Kelemvor, but is waiting to see if his actions live up to his promises.

@2701 = ~magistrati of azuth~
@2702 = ~Magistrati of Azuth~
@2703 = ~MAGISTRATI OF AZUTH: Azuth (Ah-ZOOTH) is the god of wizards and mages and to a much lesser degree, all spellcasters, as opposed to Mystra, who is the goddess of all magic. Azuth is Mystra's servant, friend, and advisor. This last role has become even more important in the years since the Time of Troubles. Before the Godswar, he and Mystra were much closer and very affectionate toward one another, but Azuth's relationship with Midnight/Mystra is much more professional. He regards the new Mystra as an inexperienced daughter facing a taxing and complex job whom he must coach to allow her to best perform her duties. In religious art, Azuth is most often portrayed as a bearded old man unbent by age, wielding a stout, gem-topped staff.

Savras the All-Seeing, a rival god of mages whom Azuth defeated, was Azuth's foe for centuries. Savras now serves Azuth, albeit uneasily, as a demipower of diviners and truth-speakers. The two deities seem to cautiously be working toward friendship and a formal division of duties, albeit with Savras continuing to serve Azuth. Azuth also works closely to guide the Magister, the mortal spellwielding champion of magic who serves Mystra. Likewise, Velsharoon, demipower of necromancy, must pay at least lip service to Azuth's commands.

Azuth is a sober sort of father-figure deity, but he is not humorless or mean-spirited. He has a rather dry, sardonic wit and appreciates plays on words and subtle humor. He has perfected a straight-faced delivery to such a degree that often those who hear him speak are left wondering whether some of his comments were said seriously or in jest. When he is in good humor, he likes to present those who have called on him with small gifts, such as flowers in unusual colors, magical fabric of elegant drape, or edible delicacies. When he is upset, his wrath is terrible to behold as the air crackles with magical energy about him that seems to flow both into and out of his eyes and the Old Staff, a divine artifact of ancient construction that he wields to devastating effect.

//						       Doomscribe of Jergal
//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@2801 = ~doomscribe of jergal~
@2802 = ~Doomscribe of Jergal~
@2803 = ~DOOMSCRIBE OF JERGAL: Jergal (JER-gull), Lord of the End of Everything, is responsible for keeping records on the final disposition of all the spirits of the dead. He is the fatalistic undertaker who strives for order in death, anticipating the ever-encroaching termination of all things living. Jergal strives for an orderly accounting of the fate of the world as it slowly sinks into death. Few mortals are even aware of Jergal's existence except for a few sages studying ancient history.

Jergal was Myrkul's predecessor as Lord of the Dead, although he apparently voluntarily relinquished that position to the Lord of Bones many centuries ago. Some sages believe Jergal held the portfolios of Bhaal and Bane at that time, as well, and was venerated as Nakasr by the Netherese survivor states. After stepping down from his position, Jergal became the Seneschal of Bone Castle, assisting Myrkul in the execution of his duties. In the intervening centuries, Jergal become the Forgotten One and faded into Myrkul's shadow.

Jergal played no part in the Time of Troubles, but when Cyric succeeded Myrkul as Lord of the Dead, the Scribe of the Doomed continued to serve as the Seneschal of Bone Castle. A core component of his very being makes Jergal absolutely loyal to the current Lord of the Dead, regardless of who holds that office. From Jergal's action during Cyric's tenure, however, it is apparent that while Jergal is utterly loyal to the office of Lord of the Dead, he does have freedom to subtly undermine the current officeholder is she or he is not true to the position's responsibilities.

Jergal seems to find working with Kelemvor, the new Lord of the Dead, much more to his personal satisfaction. The Forgotten One serves the Judge of the Damned as seneschal by maintaining careful records of all who enter the Crystal Spire, Kelemvor's new abode build on the rubble of the Bone Castle. It is possible that Jergal will regain some of his former prominence serving Kelemvor, but it is equally likely that the Seneschal of the Crystal Spire will pass on into death himself, having found a suitable successor to his old position. Regardless, the Scribe of the Doomed has little apparent interest in the living save for recording their final fates.

Jergal retains a fondness from Netheril's heyday for the long-vanished Amaunator, valuing that ancient sun god's adherence to law and order, but he otherwise has few allies aside from Kelemvor, and even fewer friends. Following the events of the Cyrinishad debacle, Jergal has nothing but scorn for Cyric, the former Lord of the Dead, considering him anathema to the orderly dissolution of the universe. In the aftermath of Velsharoon's divine ascendance, Jergal spends much of his efforts in the Realms combating the Necromancer's efforts to prolong life into undeath and to thwart the orderly procession of death in the Realms.

Jergal never angers, and always speaks with a disembodied, chilling voice that echoes with the dry whisper of a long forgotten crypt. His tone is always blind, his word fatalistic, and his demeanor excessively formal. Most mortals find the Forgotten One a shadowy, sinister figure who leaves a vague feeling of unease and enervation in his wake. Jergal is totally focused on death and perceives life as momentary existence before death's eternity. A few bards have noted that Jergal's philosophy and actions resemble a mortal attempting to tidy up his affairs and accounts before his imminent death.

This monstrous scribe is depicted in his religion's art as a smooth gray face holding no features other than a pair of bulging yellow eyes. His body is nothing but a shadow-filled gray cloak which rises and falls as if buffeted by an unseen wind, and he wears white gloves that are supported by invisible hands and arms.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@2901 = ~holy strategist of the red knight~
@2902 = ~Holy Strategist of The Red Knight~
@2903 = ~HOLY STRATEGIST OF THE RED KNIGHT: The Red Knight serves Tempus, the Lord of War, as the goddess of planning and strategy. She is portrayed as a dark-haired woman in blood-red armor, with a map of the Realms tightly clasped in her hands. The Red Knight keeps her true name secret from all but the Lord of Battles, as she realizes that if any power, mortal or divine, were to gain any measure of control over her, they would be privy to all the plots and stratagems of rulers throughout the Realms and the powers throughout the planes.

The Red Knight is venerated by the Foehammer's followers in a secondary position to the Lord of Battles. Only since the Time of Troubles has a small priesthood distinct from that of the Foehammer arisen in her name. This small priesthood, owing it existence in part to the increasingly complex nature of war, is grudgingly tolerated by Tempurans and apparently encouraged by the Lord of Battles himself. Some sages speculate that Tempus has sponsored the Red Knight to the rank of demipower and encouraged her worship as a natural counterbalance to Garagos the Reaver, his mortal enemy.

The Lady of Strategy is calm and logical in demeanor, but displays a great wealth of compassion, though she is unafraid to send her worshipers to their deaths when necessary to secure the objective of a plan. She rarely raises her voice and is said to love a good joke and have a throaty laugh. She dislikes flighty behavior, and looks unfavorably upon those who switch alliances often or capriciously.

The Red Knight see Tempus as a father figure, and the two spend a great deal of time together. They sometimes hunt together or exchange tales in his feasting hall, but most often they are busy visiting the numerous fields of battle in Faerun or reviewing battles of times past. The Red Knight sees Valkur as her best ally in the disposition of naval conflicts, though her expectations of him sometimes exceed his demonstrated level of commitment to all but the protection of sailors. The Red Knight and Torm are similar in disposition, and their interests in battle and the duties of warriors coincide well. She is known to be fond of him, but whether they are in love or merely close friends is a matter they have kept very private. The Lady of Strategy dislikes Garagos from what she has been told of his behavior by Tempus, though she personally has not come to blows with him. Her animosity is reserved for Cyric, who she despies as the utmost of traitors and liars and a poor planner besides.

During the Time of Troubles, the Red Knight was active in Tethyr defending the strife-torn nation against an army of monsters that threatened to surge forth from the Forest of Tethir. Her military genius was decisive in numerous battles where the small, but determined, Company of the Red Falcon overwhelmed numerically superior armies of beasts and humanoids.

//				               Bloodreaver of Garagos
//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@3001 = ~bloodreaver of garagos~
@3002 = ~Bloodreaver of Garagos~
@3003 = ~BLOODREAVER OF GARAGOS: Some legends claim Garagos (GAH-rah-gos) was the primary war god in western Faerûn until he was overthrown by the upstart Tempus. Certainly Garagos was worshiped in Westgate and the Vilhon Reach during the days of Myth Drannor, and his faith was strong long before that time—reportedly even in ancient Netheril. He was thought killed by Tempus, as he is recorded as slain, but either this means that he was destroyed as the primary war god of Faerûn, a position which Tempus took from him as the spoils of their one-on-one battle, or he was resurrected by some of his diehard cultists along the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars, in the Vilhon Reach, or in the Border Kingdoms. He is most certainly not dead, but alive.

Garagos is associated with the rampaging destruction and plundering of war than tactics, strategies, or armies. The Reaver is linked with the mad bloodlust that overtakes some warriors, resulting in horrifying carnage. (Followers of Tempus claim their god destroyed Garagos by using the Reaver's berserking fury against him.) The scarlet cloak he is portrayed as wearing in religious art is one made of the blood of his foes, and in recent times he is often shown wading through a blood-red sea—again, the blood of his slain enemies.

In 1368 DR, Garagos reappeared to crush an impostor, the marilith Glackzana, a tanar'ri who had been attempting to start a cult in his name using her powers to present herself in a form like that of his avatar. He demolished the temple built to her at the ruined villager of Gosra, located in the Fields of Nun of central Chondath, and ordered it reconstructed in a more grand manner and rededicated to his worship.

Garagos himself scorns the use of armor (though he does not care if his priests wear it) and admires those who give in to battle-lust and merciless destruction in conflict, destroying all that lies in their path and taking no prisoners. He is blood-thirsty and single-minded. He angers quickly and cools down from an emotional boil very slowly. He is feared for the damage he can do and the uncontrolled nature of his fury.

Garagos was even more even-tempered and less prone to explode of old, but since his defeat by Tempus his fuse has gotten shorter, and he has lost all sense of mercy once he becomes caught up in a battle. With the change in his disposition, he no longer felt comfortable in his former abode in Limbo and moved to Pandemonium. Some say that he moved to his new abode when his heart grew hard upon finally giving up all hope for attaining his secret love. Others say this is so much poppycock, and speculate that Garagos is finally going over the edge to outright evil he has been teetering on for so long.

When chaotic combat is cast on a creature, it is inspired beyond his years of training and is suddenly struck with numerous insights for variations on the standard moves of attack and defense.

Unfortunately, these insights are helpful in only four-fifths (80%) of the warrior's attacks. In the remaining attacks, the spell actually impairs the warrior's standard performance. This spell takes effect at the beginning of each round. On a positive roll the target gains bonuses of +2 to Thac0 and Armor Class. On a negative roll, the target suffers a -2 penalty to Thac0 and Armor Class.~

This spell enshrouds the priest in an armor of dense blood. Any weapon used to attack the Bloodreaver seems to impact on a iron wall as the blood momentarily coagulates to form a bulwark against the imminent attack.

//				                   Seer of Savras
//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@3101 = ~seer of savras~
@3102 = ~Seer of Savras~
@3103 = ~SEER OF SAVRAS: Savras (SAHV-ras) is believed to know all that has happened and all that will occur. Some claim that he I guides the forces of fate, while others believe he is I cursed to know all of history but is unable to affect I its flow.

Savras was a long-ago god of the South who was I worshiped in Halruaa, Durpar, Estagund, Dambrath, and Var the Golden, with small pockets in Calimshan, Tethyr, and Amn. He was once as powerful as Azuth and shared much of the same portfolio: mages in the service of Mystra, goddess of magic. The two contended during or slightly after the Dawn Cataclysm, and Savras fell. Azuth became the one god of wizards, and the All-Seeing One's essence was imprisoned in an artifact of Azuth's construction that came to be known as the Scepter of Savras.

The Lord of Spells, as Azuth was thereafter known, intended to keep the scepter in which Savras was imprisoned as his staff of office. Although reduced to demipower status, Savras was still powerful enough to block Azuth's divination abilities and teleport his prison into the Realms where it passed beyond Azuth's reach.

While the All-Seeing One was imprisoned in the relic, Savras's worshipers slowly dwindled, disheartened by the disappearance of their god and pilloried by the followers of Azuth. His final worshiper of note was Alaundo the Seer, to whom he revealed only visions that would come true, and thus Alaundo is the only true prophet of the Realms.

Eventually the Scepter of Savras past into the hands of Sylune Silver-hand, one of the Seven Sisters. She employed the artifact for quite some time, ignoring Savras's entreaties to be freed. Sylune finally returned the Scepter to Azuth after uncovering secret doings of the gods that Mystra deemed it better for mortals not to know.

After reacquiring the relic, Azuth found himself troubled by Savras's long imprisonment. Following the Time of Troubles, the Patron of Wizards agreed to Savras's request to be released in exchange for a pledge of fealty by Savras to the High One. Today Savras is a demipower who serves Azuth, albeit uneasily. The two powers seem to be cautiously working toward friendship and a formal division of portfolios.

Some sages and devout defenders of the All-Seeing One believe that Savras deliberately lost his battle with Azuth, having chosen the more favorable outcome in the long-run. The followers of Azuth hotly contest any such implication. Some lorebooks recount that Azuth was the victor because his personal drive and passionate nature at the time complemented the restraint of Mystra, and she favored him over Savras, who was more cautious and distant like herself. Many sages who have studied the relationships of the powers in the past find this to be not an unlikely premise, since previous to his ascending to godhood Mystra had favored Azuth by naming him the first Magister.

The All-Seeing One is a cautious, logical power given to long intervals of meditative silence. He despises anyone or any power who would obscure the truth, and thus he opposes Cyric and Mask (and opposed Leira) at every opportunity. He also dislikes brutal destruction and killing for no end, and so Bhaal found him no friend, and Talos still does not. Bane's insufferable arrogance set Savras's teeth on edge (along with his evil behavior), and those who display overweening pride and arrogance still irk him. He serves Azuth to honor their agreement and a distant respect for their ancient rivalry and Mystra out of duty and a sort of misplaced affection, as the personality of the first Mystra, whose very presence warmed his spirit, is no longer.

Savras's statements are clear, precise, and rarely what the listener wants to hear. He always speaks the absolute truth, and in cases where the truth is a matter of perspective, he reveals all sides of the truth. There is little compassion or emotion in Savras's actions or demeanor, but sages speculate this seemingly emotionless facade is merely a front for a power who cares deeply about the fate of the Realms but finds himself relatively helpless to change its destiny. Savras almost never loses his temper, but when he does, his wrath is dreadful.

@3201 = ~necrophant of velsharoon~
@3202 = ~Necrophant of Velsharoon~
@3203 = ~NECROPHANT OF VELSHAROON: Velsharoon (VEL-shah-roon) is the Archmage of Necromancy, a demipower who has gathered the study, practice, and practitioners of necromancy and evil liches into his portfolio and who is striving to add general undeath as well. Newly elevated to a divine state, the Lord of the Forgotten Crypt is only beginning to create a cult of worshipers in the Realms. Although many prognosticators, mortals and immortals alike, have predicted the quick destruction of this arrogant necromancer, Velsharoon has played one power off against another, and he has begun to establish himself in the Faerunian pantheon.

As a mortal, Velsharoon was a renegade Red Wizard of Thay who lived in the Tower Terrible in Soorenar as well as several other abodes. He aspired to the position of Zulkir of Necromancy, but was driven from that land centuries ago after feuding with his chief rival, Szass Tarn, and several other powerful Red Wizards. Nearly as powerful as his archrival, Velsharoon spent many decades seeking enough power to destroy Tarn and other wizards who challenged his evil machinations, including Haider of Delzimmer, Omm Hlandrar of Halruaa, the Simbul of Aglarond, and Elminster of Shadowdale.

In a very old ruin in the Plains of Purple Dust, southwest of the city of Zindalankh on the Sempharwater, Velsharoon discovered a process laid down long ago by Talos the Destroyer by which a great wizard can achieve demipowerhood. The Vaunted, as the archnecromancer was sometimes pilloried, managed to complete the ritual, which first turned him into a lich, and ascended into the ranks of Faerûn's pantheon with the Destroyer's sponsorship at the end of 1368 DR. (Sages speculate Ao allowed his ascension to provide a balance to the new Lord of the Dead's dislike for the undead.)

Velsharoon served the Storm Lord dutifully, if not loyally, for two years before realizing that Talos was forcing him to expend his divine energy at a profligate pace. Unwilling to be worn out like a footsoldier's marching boots, Velsharoon shifted his allegiance to Azuth after forging an alliance of convenience with the Patron of Wizards. Infuriated, Talos railed against his fickle servant, but Azuth, with Mystra's help, backed the Archmage of Necromancy in a bid to redress Talos's encroachment on Mystra's province of magic. After Talos calmed down, Velsharoon made a secret alliance of convenience with the Destroyer, and he now plays Azuth and Talos off against each other. Officially, Velsharoon serves Azuth as the power primarily concerned with one class of specialist wizard — necromancers — much like Savras the All-Seeing serves Azuth as a patron of diviners. Unofficially, Velsharoon continues to aid Talos's quest for perennial destruction by encouraging his followers to unleash their horrible creations on an unsuspecting world.

Azuth remains an unlikely and unhappy ally of Velsharoon, and Talos seems to be biding his time until the Lord of the Forgotten Crypt gets his comeuppance. Kelemvor, the new Lord of the Dead, and Jergal, Scribe of the Doomed, actively oppose Velsharoon as his predilection for black necromancy violates many of their most cherished tenets. Cyric and Velsharoon share a mutual enmity as both seek to acquire a larger portfolio at the expense of Kelemvor. Finally, though they are not yet numbered among his enemies, it is likely that Velsharoon will soon find himself opposed by the myriad powers of nature, by the Triad of law and good (Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater), and by Lathander, the Morninglord.

Velsharoon is a vain, selfish, petty, but very canny power consumed with vengeance, obsessed with experimenting on living and dead beings, and unconcerned with the fates of lesser creatures. In many ways he continues to act like the mortal he recently was, albeit with far greater power at his disposal than before.

@3301 = ~mistcaller of leira~
@3302 = ~Mistcaller of Leira~
@3303 = ~MISTCALLER OF LEIRA: Leira (LAlR-uh), the Lady of the Mists, was the goddess of deception and illusion and the patroness of illusionists and liars. Few people other than illusionists saw profit in misunderstanding and deception, so she had few lay worshipers, though many casual worshipers paid her homage to ward her off or placate her before important decisions and judgments were made. Her true appearance was never known, and she was never depicted in (uncensored) religious art. Swirling gray mists — sometimes in a vaguely humanoid form—were always shown to represent her, and her horned altars framed no image above them. She is credited with inventing the language of Ruathlek, the written tongue of illusionary magic.

Despite a fog of counterclaims and declarations, Leira perished shortly after the Time of Troubles at the hands of Cyric and Mask (in the form of Godsbane). Mask betrayed her to Cyric, and the goddess's portfolio was subsumed by Cyric. Churches of Leira still operate, and their priests receive spells, but these are granted by Cyric in the guise of Leira, although the Leiran either do not know (most of them) or do not care.

Leira was an enigma since she covered everything she did and said with layers of illusion and falsehood. She was not an actively malicious power, however, and it is known that those few who managed to visit her realm in Limbo uninvited were normally trapped or restrained rather than simply being atomized, as is the practice of most evil or impatient powers. She was apparently content with her small following and had no great and glorious plans or ambitions. On a personal level, she seems to have been a very private power, and the only passing friendship she maintained was with Mask — who treacherously betrayed her to her death at the hands of power-hungry Cyric. She had a formal, cooperative relationship with Azuth, patron of spellcasters, and was disliked by Tyr, who pursues justice through truth.

@3401 = ~luckbringer of tymora~
@3402 = ~Luckbringer of Tymora~
@3403 = ~LUCKBRINGER OF TYMORA: Tymora (Tie-MORE-ah) is sometimes called Tyche's fair-haired or fair-tressed daughter or Beshaba's I bright sister, but these are more poetic titles than I designations of her maternal lineage or her hair I color. In actuality, Tymora is half of the deity once known as Tyche, with Beshaba being the other half. Tymora inherited Tyche's grace and kindness when that goddess split into two beings in the Dawn Cataclysm, a war among the gods that long preceded the Time of Troubles and is said to have heralded the fall of Myth Drannor. Beshaba garnered more of Tyche's wanton, willful nature, sensual side, and restless energy.

Tymora's faith is one of the most common in the Faerûn, in particular since it caters most heavily to a highly mobile, relatively wealthy, and intrinsically powerful group who live by their wits and by their luck: adventurers. Tymora is fickle but playful and never vengeful or malicious. She likes a good joke and has been known to play an occasional practical joke on some of the more straight-laced Faerunian deities, such as Helm and Tyr. She is reputed by sages to have had short-lived romances with several of the good male deities of Faerûn, but these ended amicably on both sides after a short while. She likes merriment and festive occasions and rumors abound at gaming houses throughout Faerûn of people who spotted her at the tables during one holiday or another, laughing and having a good time with all.

//__________________________________________________________________________________
@3501 = ~black finger of beshaba~
@3502 = ~Black Finger of Beshaba~
@3503 = ~BLACK FINGER OF BESHABA: Beshaba (Beh-SHAH-ba), the Maid of Misfortune, is a deity feared and placated in Faerûn much more than she is venerated. When represented, she is shown much like her avatar appears, as a lovely maiden with snow-white hair, her features twisted by maniacal laughter. In Anauroch, where she pretends that she is Shaundakul to perform mischievous and malicious tricks (such as causing oases to dry out, blinding people, and causing travelers to get lost), she appears as a jackal-headed man. Needless to say, this behavior has done much to befoul the reputation of the real Shaundakul.

She is known as Tyche's unpleasant daughter, but this is more a poetic title than one designating her maternal lineage. In actuality, Tyche was not her mother in the sense of giving birth to Beshaba, rather Beshaba is half of the deity once known as Tyche, with Tymora being the other half. It is said among sages that when Tyche split to become her two warring "daughters" in the Dawn Cataclysm, Beshaba got the looks, and Tymora all the love. Certainly many men seem to lose their senses when they meet the gaze of Beshaba, either being overwhelmed with lust and driven to carry out Beshaba's every whim in reckless, slobbering haste or descending into pure gibbering madness on the spot. In women, her gaze is said to inspire mania reflective of Beshaba's own inner turmoil or a similar insanity.

Beshaba is spiteful, petty and malicious. While most people tremble in fear at Beshaba's attendance at any event even in spirit, Beshaba is almost always invited and welcomed formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions (such as marriages and coronations), contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she is not so invited, she may take offense and wreak endless misfortune upon those involved. She is difficult to understand as her actions often seem random, but in the main she is jealous of the favorable opinion people have of her sister and demands equal veneration (or at least equal lip service) to that given to Tymora or she will ruin the lives who so slight her.

Talos has recently been courting the affections of Beshaba, perhaps with an eye toward eventually controlling misfortune and bad luck along with destruction. Beshaba has not returned his overtures.

//	   		                 Doombringer of Hoar
//__________________________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________________________
@3601 = ~doombringer of hoar~
@3602 = ~Doombringer of Hoar~
@3603 = ~DOOMBRINGER OF HOAR: Hoar (HORE) the Doombringer is not often actively worshiped in set services, but his name is invoked by those seeking vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate (such as when a murderer is killed accidentally just after the murder is committed, particularly if the accident—for example, slipping to his death—was initiated by the murderer himself), the hand of Hoar is given credit. Hoar has a more benign aspect in the North, where he is seen less as a god of vengeance and more as a god of poetic justice. Many bounty hunters and some assassins propitiate the Doombringer before commencing a hunt, the truly faithful among them seeking to capture their quarry in a suitably ironic style.

Hoar is actually an ancient Untheric deity worshiped in the Inner Sea Lands as Assuran, Lord of Three Thunders. He and his worship were driven from that land in centuries past by priests of Ramman around the same time that Hoar battled and lost to that Untheric god of war, thunder, rains, and storms in a tumultuous conflict.

Although worship of the Lord of Three Thunders dropped off rapidly in Unther (to the point where Assuran) was no longer considered part of the Untheric pantheon), the cult of the Doombringer remained strong in Chessenta for many years, particularly in the cities of Akanax and Mourktar. In the past century, Assuran's worship again declined precipitously in size when Chessentan mercenaries returning from Mulhorand brought with them the faith of Anhur. Although the officers remained faithful to Assuran, many soldiers converted to the faith of the Mulhorandi god of war.

During the Time of Troubles, Hoar/Assuran took as his mortal avatar the body of King Hippartes of Akanax. After traveling to Thay to obtain a cache of weapons he had hidden in the Thaymounts (and narrowly evading the plots of a Red Wizard known as the Masked One), Hoar commanded the army of Akanax and several hired mercenary companies into wars against the neighboring cities of Cimbar, Soorenar, and Luthcheq in revenge for ancient insults. The Doombringer incited several long-simmering conflicts between those cities as well, plunging most of Chessenta into war. After a string of victories against ancient foes of Akanax and himself, he forged an alliance between Chessenta's fractious cities. He then turned Akanax's armies against Unther and against the church of Ramman in particular. Ramman's avatar met him face-to-face and toe-to-toe, and in an act of poetic justice, the Doombringer wove a powerful spell that slew Ramman by causing a bolt of lightning to rebound after the Untheric storm god's third thunderous lightning attack. However, once again Assuran lost out when, before he could seize Ramman's portfolio, the Untheric lord of war passed it on to Anhur, war god of Mulhorand, and left the Realms permanently. The revitalized Mulhorandi god of war led his troops to Unther's defense and routed the Chessentan mercenaries, many of whom defected to his side. The Doombringer was once again driven from Unther in defeat.

Although his worship had been spreading slowly through the Heartlands prior to the Time of Troubles, Hoar's direct action in the Realms has not been felt since the Time of Troubles, and his sign (three deep rolls of thunder) has not been heard in the Inner Sea lands for a decade. Although some speculate that he died during the Time of Troubles, the truth is that he has retreated into himself and cut off many of his routine activities to plot his revenge against Anhur. Combined with the massive defection of worshipers from his faith in battered Chessenta, the Lord of Three Thunders has found himself reduced to demipower status throughout the Realms in the aftermath of the Godswar.

Hoar is a moody power, prone to violence and with a penchant toward bitter humor. He alternately curses Tymora for his fate and attempts to unctuously wheedle her for better luck, treating her at times as an enemy and at others as a friend. He seeks to aid the Maiden of Misfortune in unleashing bad luck on the deserving. He has a dry, hollow chuckle, a haunted appearance, and a morbid fascination in the plight of doomed mortals. It is said that both Tyr and Shar contest for Hoar's tormented soul. Shar seeks to twist the Doombringer into a servant of blind vengeance and bitterness, while Tyr seeks to unlock his bittersweet humor and shift his portfolio towards irony and poetic justice, but to this date he serves no one's interests but his own.

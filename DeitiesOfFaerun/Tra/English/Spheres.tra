By reciting a sacred passage or declaration, the priest invokes <PRO_HISHER> deity's blessing upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> allies while sowing confusion and weakness among <PRO_HISHER> enemies. The priest's allies gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls and Saving Throws, and the priest's enemies receive a -2 penalty to the same. Recitation does not nullify a Prayer spellâ€”the two can be cast in tandem, and the effects are cumulative.~

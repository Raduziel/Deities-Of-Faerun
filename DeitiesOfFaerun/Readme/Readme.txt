Welcome and thanks for installing Deities of Faerun.

INSTALLATION NOTES:

* Deities of Faerûn is not compatible with Faiths and Powers.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed after any mod that adds or alters items in the game.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed after any mod that adds or alters spells in the game.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed after mods that introduce NPCs that receives a kit from DoF.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed after mods that introduce Kits that will use the Sphere System.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed before Improved Shamanic Dance.

* Deities of Faerûn should be installed after EET (but ALWAYS before EET_End).

* Deities of Faerûn will probably misbehave with any mod component that overhauls the combat system of the game.

* Deities of Faerûn will probably misbehave with any mod component that alters the strongholds quests (except for those that exclusively remove the one-stronghold limit).

* Deities of Faerûn is not compatible with any mods that alters the Cleric and will break any kit added by other mods (except for the Spirit Redeemer from I Hate Undead) - this can be fixed doing the following:

Add "clswpbon = ~0 0 3~" (no quotation marks) in the ADD_KIT routine of the kit's tpa/tp2 as the example below:

.................................................
| LAF fl#add_kit_ee                             |
|	STR_VAR                                 |
|		kit_name = ~KitInternalName~    |
|		clswpbon = ~0 0 3~              |
|		(...)                           |
| END                                           |
.................................................

-- A special note about Tweaks Anthology --

i) Use Character Colors Instead of Item Colors // This turns the Use Kit's Colors component redundant.

ii) Multiple Strongholds - any stronghold for anyone // This turns the Stronghold Alterings component redundant.

iii) Multiple Strongholds - more than one stronghold // I didn't test to see how this behaves with the Stronghold Alterings. Probably they will work fine together.

iv) Universal Clubs, Weapon Styles for all // Will not break anything, but will remove part of DoF's flavor (reproduce the kits as they are in PnP).

v) Alter Weapon Proficiency System // This one will probably break DoF as every kit has specific restrictions.

vi) Multiclass Grandmastery // This component may turn some deities features redundant (like Alaghar of Clangeddin being able to put *** in Axes/Hammers as Clerics or F/C)

vii) Alter Multiclass Restriction // This has the possibility of allowing players to make combinations that were not forecasted by DoF. This may lead to misbehaves.

viii) Remove Racial Restrictions for Kits // This component will not break anything in terms of mechanics but will do so when it comes to lore. Some deities/pantheons are restricted to specific races for lore reasons.

ix) Paladins Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression/Rangers Use IWD-HoW Spell Progression // This one may cause problems as DoF's Sphere System enforces BG's spell progression in IWD (because it is the one used in PnP). Due to that, the Sphere System does not embrace Rangers with a spellcasting over the third circle and Paladins with a spellcasting over the fourth circle.

x) Loosen Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Clerics/Change Item Restrictions for Multi- and Dual-class Druids // As DoF uses specific items restrictions for every kit, this component may lead to unexpected behaves.

xi) Everyone Gets Bonus APR from Specialization // This component will turn some deities' features redundant. In DoF, extra-APR is something precious and the kits that have access to this feature have a drawback in the form of a smaller sphere selection.

xii) Allow Mages to Use Bucklers and Thieves to Use Small Shields // Some deities specifically bans shields, and some of those have C/M and C/T multiclasses. This component will remove this restriction.

xiii) Give Every Class/Kit Four Weapon Slots // The warrior-like deities from DoF have as a way of balance its extra APR and sometimes specialization the fact that it gets fewer weapon slots. This component may affect the balance.

KNOWN ISSUES:

* Anomen will be able to get proficiencies as a kitless Fighter (5 slots in every weapon). There is nothing I can do about it. He is still bounded to equipment restriction, so be aware that a Watcher of Helm can only use bludgeoning weapons. Installing Kjeron's Dual-Class-Into-Kits fixes this.

* The F/C or R/C versions of the kits that have as a feature "Hit Dice: d10" will have problems with its HP count. It happens because the multiclass function uses the priests standard HD (d8) to build the average HP we see in multiclasses. Having a d10 HD, the average HD for those kits should be d10 ([10+10]/2), but instead, it receives a d9 ([10+8]/2).

To solve this I've created a spell that is applied every level permanently giving 1 HP to the designed character. The problem is, the opcode that does this is not read during Character Generation, so some HP is not gained. The loss is presented below:

BGEE/BP1/IWDEE 1 HP | SoD/BG2EE</i>  6 HP | HoW/BP2 9 HP | ToB 13 HP

To solve this gap you'll need to enable the console commands and enter the following code (you can Copy/Paste it) with the mouse over the designed character.

........................................................................
|                                                                      |
|   C:Eval('ActionOverride(Myself,ApplySpellRES("RAHPFIX",Myself))')   |
|                                                                      |
........................................................................

Every time you do this, 1 HP will be permanently added to the character. So you'll need to do this once for BGEE/BP1/IWDEE, six times for SoD/BGEE, nine times for How/BP2 and thirteen times for ToB. Seems like a lot of trouble but it is quite easy and this needs to be done just after the character creation. So if you're importing a character from BG1 to BG2 you don't need to do this (as long as you did it in BG1). The same goes for BG2 and ToB, IWD and HoW.

The remaining level ups will apply this spell automatically, so this really is a one-time-thing. Sorry about that, but it is an engine issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This mod contains the following components:



a) Base changes

Those are needed for the rest of the mod. Basically it install all the new BAMs and removes restrictions from the base cleric, so the kits can have their weapon restrictions accordingly to PnP. These changes will affect *every* cleric, including the base class and kits introduced from other mods.



====================================================================================================================================================================



b) Kits

The four effects of the spell are as follows:

By means of this spell, the caster is able to change a specially prepared staff into a treant-like creature of the largest size, about 24 feet tall. When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treant-like creature. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdust-like powder and the staff is destroyed.

Sphere: Protection 
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is known as wyvern watch because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by its casting, which vaguely resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion. Any creature that approaches the guarded area may be affected by the "wyvern" and must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spells or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the Watcher, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern-form, and the intruder was not affected.

Sphere: Creation 
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7

The blade can strike four times per round, doing 2d4 points of damage with each successful hit, but cannot act beyond the caster's line of sight.

Although it has no attack or damage bonuses, a Seeking Sword is considered a +4 magical weapon for determining what sorts of beings it can strike and can only be harmed by fire, electricity, magic, acid or crushing damage. Other spell casting is impossible for the duration of the spell.

The spell recipient glows with a rose-red radiance during this time of augmented ability. This radiance is similar to faerie fire in appearance, but it does not carry with it the benefits that opponents would gain when attacking a creature outlined in faerie fire.

---

Faerie Fire

Sphere: Sun

Duration: 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

====================================================================================================================================================================

9) MASK

Shadowcloak
(Alteration)

Sphere: Darkness, Trickery
Range: 0

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a semisolid fog of amorphous shape that engulfs the caster and moves with <PRO_HIMHER> for the duration of the spell.

A shadowcloak both confuses attackers with its swirling, smoky chaos, and slows strikes, so that all attacks against the shadowcloak-user occur at a -3 attack penalty and a damage penalty of-1 point per die. The shadowcloak also muffles all sounds made by the cloaked being (regardless of that being's desires), so that even shouted speech seems faint and distant, and all sounds short of breakage or metallic ringing or clinking are very likely to be completely blanked out.

The shadowcloak grants to the Silentwalker a 100% bonus to Move Silently and a 50% bonus do Hide in Shadows.

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Ice Elemental spell, the Icevassal opens a special gate to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, and an ice elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.

On this second round, the victim must make another Saving Throw. If it succeeds, the victim suffers 1 point of damage, is corroded as discussed above, and the spell ends. If this second Saving Throw fails, the victim suffers 3d6 points of additional damage, loses another 2 points of Charisma, and the third (and final) stage of the poison begins.

This spell summons an Erinyes to serve the Pain. While summoned, there's a chance that the devil will escape from the summoner's control and turn against <PRO_HIMHER>. This chance starts at 5% and increases by another 5% every turn until it reaches 100% after 20 turns, when the spell expires. If the summoner is under the effect of Protection from Evil before losing control over the Devil, the Erinyes will return to Baator instead of attacking. Only one Erinyes can be summoned at time. Unless the devil goes hostile, the summoner may dismiss the Erinyes whenever <PRO_HESHE> wants.

To dismiss the Erinyes, go to the creature's special abilities and press "Dismiss".

====================================================================================================================================================================

On top of the new spells and special abilities, every kit will get a Holy Symbol at level 25. Every kit get its own Holy Symbol, but their powers are the same and are listed below:

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
 Bless
 Turn Undead Level: +1
 Decrease spellcasting time by 1
 Can memorize one extra divine spell from level 1 to 7

Weight: 0



====================================================================================================================================================================



c) Kits to NPCs

This component will give the kit for a NPC that follows that deity. So Viconia will become a Nightcloak of Shar, Quayle a Hoodwinker of Baravar Cloakshadow and Anomen a Watcher of Helm. And so it goes.

This component also alters stats (raising it to the kit's minimum), alignment (altering it to the kit's restriction) and proficiencies (to be in line with what the kit allows) when necessary. Also the NPCs special abilities will be removed (as Yeslick's Dispel Magic and Branwen's Spiritual Hammer) for balance reasons.



====================================================================================================================================================================



d) New strongholds possibilities

Some kits will be able to get strongholds non-related to the cleric's one (as listed below). Notice that the one-stronghold rule still applies, so even with Tyr being eligible for three strongholds (Helm, Fighter and Paladin) chosen one will make you lose the possibility of getting another. 

- Auril: Talos

- Azuth: Wizard

- Baervan Wildwanderer : Druid, Ranger

- Bane: Talos, Fighter

- Baravar Cloakshadow: Thief

- Beshaba: Talos

- Clangeddin: Helm, Fighter
                                                                
- Cyric: Talos, Thief

- Eldath: Lathander, Druid

- Garagos: Talos                                   
                 
- Helm: Helm

- Hoar: Helm

- Ilmater: Lathander

- Jergal: Helm

- Kelemvor: Helm

- Lathander: Lathander

- Loviatar: Talos

- Malar: Talos, Druid

- Mask: Talos, Thief

- Mystra: Wizard

- Oghma: Bard, Wizard

- Red Knight: Helm, Fighter

- Savras: Wizard

- Selûne: Lathander

- Shar: Talos

- Shaundakul: Ranger

- Shiallia: Druid

- Sune: Lathander, Bard

- Talona: Talos                                   

- Talos: Talos

- Tempus: Fighter

- Torm: Helm, Paladin

- Tymora: Lathander

- Tyr: Helm, Paladin

- Umberlee: Talos

- Valkur: Lathander

- Velsharoon: Talos, Wizard

Without this component the strongholds will be chosen by alignment, as the unmodded game does.



====================================================================================================================================================================



e) Kits' Colors

This component will make all non-magical armors, helmets and shields use the kit's assigned colors instead of those imposed by the item.

THANKS

I have a lot of people to say "Thank You".

Kjeron undoubtedly deserves a huge thank you as he guided me through this long journey. I learned a lot from him.

Subtledoctor and Grammarsalad also deserve a big thank you. When I approached them saying that I wanted to make a cleric kitpack they were very supportive.

CrevsDaak's guide "[How to] Making kit mods for the EE!" made this kitpack possible. To be honest, made possible that I started modding. Thanks!

CamDawg's SPELL_TO_INNATE helped me a lot in this process. His guide to modding strongholds and the code that I turned into SPELL_TO_KIT_FEATURE where very helpful too. So thanks.

Gwendolyne was fundamental to make this kitpack have so many BAMs. Thank you!

Argent77 for giving me the code that allowed the BAM files to be in the game without conflicting with any other mods. You have my thanks.

Arctodus who briefly was in this project and helped me a lot with brainstorming. Thanks, dude!

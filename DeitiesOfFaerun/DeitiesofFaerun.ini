Description = This mod adds several kits (both single class and multiclass) for clerics and has its own sphere system (which also fixes and tweaks a lot of spells). All kits were designed to respect PnP as much as possible and uses as base Powers & Patheons, Faiths & Avatars, Demihuman Deities and Monster Mythology. DoF also has the option to add kits to NPCs (including some included by mods) and its sphere system may be used by kits that are not packed within DoF. For more details - including install order - check DoF's Readme file.
